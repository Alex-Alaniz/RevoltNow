      description={`The essence of TIGER STRIKE draws from the fierce spirit of late 80s and early 90s arcade fighters, where raw energy and unstoppable force collide. This looping animated masterpiece captures the soul of a tiger, portrayed in a highly stylized vision, seamlessly hand-drawn artistry with digital finesse. Each frame reflects the meticulous journey from pencil sketch to bold vector, exploding with vibrant color and dynamic movement.

At the heart of this piece lies the tiger's rhythmic breath, resonating with deep growls that grow more powerful over time. With every exhale, faint sparks of lightning flicker across its stripes, signaling the rising storm within. His mystical first dimly/gradually ignite, glowing with a primal intensity that hints at the full force waiting to be unleashed. As the sparks dance, the light within him swells, turning his presence from a subtle glow into an overwhelming surge of energy.

The animation culminates in a mesmerizing crescendo, a dazzling explosion of radiant white light that fills the screen, momentarily eclipsing all, before the cycle begins anew. Just as the tiger never ceases to breathe, the energy never truly fadeout loops endlessly, symbolizing the unstoppable nature of raw potential and growth.

TIGER STRIKE pays homage to the legendary fighters of Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat/where each character possesses signature finishing moves, a final burst of brilliance that defines them and conquers their opponent.`}
